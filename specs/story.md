love it. here’s a tight brand story for **Irrlicht**—and how it maps to the app’s guts.

# Irrlicht — the tamed light

By night, in old stories, an *Irrlicht* lures wanderers off the path.
By day, in our terminals, the real danger is different: ten tasks, four Claude sessions, and no sense of where attention should go. The work becomes the marsh.

**Irrlicht** flips the myth: it’s the *tamed* will-o’-the-wisp—small, honest lights that appear exactly where you need them: in your macOS menu bar.

Each glow means something true:

* **●** working — the agent is thinking, building, streaming.
* **◔** waiting — it needs you; the story pauses for your judgment.
* **✓** finished — the path ahead is clear again.

No ghosts. **Hooks → State → Light.**
Under the hood, Irrlicht listens to Claude Code’s lifecycle signals, turns them into a deterministic state machine, and renders them as quiet, legible beacons. Local-first, atomic writes, zero blur.

## The metaphor, engineered

* **From folklore to signals:** The old Irrlicht misleads; *this* Irrlicht is instrumented truth—events in, state out, no superstition.
* **The marsh = concurrency:** Parallel sessions are the fog; Irrlicht sketches a clean horizon line across your menubar.
* **Lightweight sovereignty:** Tiny glyphs, instant semantics. You own the telemetry. Nothing leaves your machine.

## Voice & vibe

* **Tone:** calm, wry, technical. “Kein Spuk. Hooks.”
* **Taglines (pick one):**

  * *Irrlicht — Gezähmtes Statuslicht für Claude Code.*
  * *Follow the right light.*
  * *Blink. Decide. Ship.*
* **Icon motif:** a small will-o’-the-wisp orb with a faint tail, flanked by the three status dots (● ◔ ✓). Micro-animation: a brief, breathing glow when a session changes state.
* **Palette:** night-blues and ink-purple base, with subtle neon-mint highlights (the “truth light”). Works in dark mode without glare.

## Site & product copy (DE/EN)

* **Hero (DE):** *Irrlicht — das gezähmte Statuslicht für Claude Code. Sieh jede Session auf einen Blick: ● arbeitet · ◔ wartet · ✓ fertig.*
* **Hero (EN):** *Irrlicht — the tamed will-o’-the-wisp for Claude Code. One glance, all sessions: ● working · ◔ waiting · ✓ finished.*
* **Proof line:** *Kein Spuk. Hooks. Local-first.*

## Why this sticks

* **Name memory:** unusual, short, evocative; rooted in German lore (your origin), yet pronounceable globally (*EER-licht*).
* **Meaning fit:** “light in the dark” → literal UI beacons.
* **Design loop:** every interaction reinforces the metaphor—state changes feel like tiny guided lights, not noisy notifications.

If you’d like, I can turn this into a 1-page brand sheet (logo, colors, micro-animation spec, and final taglines) to ship with the first release.
