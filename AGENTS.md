# Irrlicht — Development Guide

## Build Artifacts

Use `./.build` for build artifacts.

## Building the daemon

- **Release builds**: `tools/build-release.sh` reads the base version from
  `version.json` and produces signed universal binaries + the installer.
  The binary's `--version` output is the bare version (e.g. `0.3.13`) so
  release tags stay clean.
- **Dev builds**: `tools/build-dev.sh` produces a native binary at
  `core/bin/irrlichd` with a version string like `0.3.13+1f702e7.dirty`
  — base version plus short SHA plus `.dirty` if the worktree has
  uncommitted changes. `+` is semver build metadata so dev binaries never
  compare as "newer" than their base release.
- The string is computed by `tools/version.sh` (pass `--base` for the
  bare version.json value). `promote-recording.sh` captures it into
  archive and top-level `manifest.json` files so the viewer's metadata
  panel shows which dev build produced each recording.

## Key Conventions

- Go code follows hexagonal architecture: `domain/` → `ports/` → `adapters/` → `application/services/`
- Three session states only: `working`, `waiting`, `ready` — no cancelled state
- Errors are logged via `Logger` interface, not propagated with `fmt.Errorf`
- Child sessions (subagents and background agents) use `ParentSessionID` for parent-child linking

## Testing

Before marking a ticket done, run the full suite — every layer must pass:

- Unit + e2e: `go test ./core/... -race -count=1` (includes the headless
  daemon startup smoke test — boots a real `irrlichd` on an ephemeral port
  under `t.TempDir()`, so it never touches the production daemon).
- Factory: `go test ./tools/onboarding-factory/... -race -count=1`.
- Replay: `tools/replay-fixtures.sh`
- replaydata integrity: `go run ./tools/onboarding-factory/cmd/of validate`
  (schema + referential integrity over the catalog + cells — a CI gate). When a
  `web/` or recording-rig change is in play, also `bash
  tools/onboarding-factory/scripts/smoke-test.sh` (the rig's `bash -n` + lib
  unit tests).
- Web (only when touching a `web/` tree): `npm test` in that tree. There are
  two independent suites, each with its own `node_modules`:
  - `platforms/web/` — the dashboard.
  - `tools/onboarding-factory/internal/viewer/web/` — the onboarding viewer.

  `npm test` runs `vitest run` (single CI-shaped pass, no watch).

## Task Management
- For larger tasks use github issues to track them
- Break down those larger tasks into tasks using a task tool (e.g. todowrite in opencode or TaskCreate in claude code)

## Follow Karpathy Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes, derived from [Andrej Karpathy's observations](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876) on LLM coding pitfalls.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.
